# AMNS_India-Databse 
ðŸš€ Excited to share my recent project on Inventory Optimization for AMNS India using Python!

ðŸ”¹ Objective:
Leveraging data analytics and machine learning, I analyzed sales trends, predicted inventory needs, and reduced overstocking using pandas, matplotlib, and predictive models.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:
âœ… Data preprocessing, feature engineering & exploratory data analysis (EDA)
âœ… Sales trend analysis & store-level performance insights
âœ… Correlation analysis between economic indicators & sales
âœ… Built a Linear Regression model for sales forecasting (MAE: 352,941)

ðŸ”¹ Impact:
ðŸ“Š Identified underperforming stores & optimized inventory levels
ðŸ“‰ Reduced stock fluctuations using a 4-week rolling average
âš¡ Enhanced decision-making with AI-driven forecasting

This project strengthened my skills in Python, data analytics, and machine learning. I'm eager to explore more AI-driven solutions in Industry 4.0!

Would love to hear your thoughts and insights! ðŸ’¡
